    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The State of Indiana Geographic Information Office and IOT Office of Technology manage a series of digital LiDAR LAS files stored in AWS, dating back to the 2011-2013 collection and including the NRCS-funded 2016-2020 collection. These LiDAR datasets are available as uncompressed LAS files, for cloud storage and access. Each year's data is organized into a tile grid scheme covering the entire geography of Indiana, ensuring easy access and efficient processing. The tiles' naming reflects each tile's lower left coordinate, facilitating accurate data management and retrieval. The AWS storage solution ensures that these extensive datasets are readily accessible for analysis and application across various projects.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
